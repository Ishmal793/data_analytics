# Python Basics: Functions, Modules, and NumPy

This notebook covers core Python programming concepts such as:

- ✅ Functions: Definitions, parameters, arguments, return values, recursion
- ✅ Lambda functions and variable scope (local vs global)
- ✅ Common function-based problems (max of three, prime check, Fibonacci, sum of list)
- ✅ Python Modules: `datetime`, `random`, and `math`
- ✅ NumPy: Array creation, indexing, slicing, reshaping, operations, aggregations, and statistics

## 🔧 Topics in Detail

### 📌 Functions
- Defining and calling functions
- Using *args for arbitrary arguments
- Recursive functions and return statements
- Lambda expressions for quick operations
- Function-based mini projects

### 📌 Modules
- Working with Python’s built-in modules:
  - `datetime` for date/time handling
  - `random` for generating random data
  - `math` for mathematical operations

### 📌 NumPy
- Creating arrays (1D, 2D)
- Indexing and slicing
- Mathematical operations (add, subtract, mod, divide, power)
- Array concatenation, stacking, and splitting
- Statistical functions: mean, median, std, var
- Filtering, searching, and correlation

# Pandas Data Handling and Transformation 🚀

This repository contains hands-on practice notebooks for learning and mastering data handling and transformation techniques using Pandas in Python.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Creating and reading DataFrames from Excel and CSV files
- Inspecting data using `head()`, `tail()`, `info()`, and `describe()`
- Handling missing values with `dropna()`, `fillna()`, and `replace()`
- Removing duplicate records
- Transforming columns and adding calculated fields
- Grouping and aggregating data using `groupby()`
- Merging and joining datasets with `merge()` and `concat()`
- Comparing DataFrames to find differences
- Pivoting and melting datasets for flexible reshaping
- Applying forward-fill, backward-fill, and mean value replacement

## 🛠 Skills Practiced

- Data Cleaning
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Transformation
- Data Aggregation
- Basic Feature Engineering

## 📂 Files

- `Pandas_Data_Handling.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all practice code examples.
- `expense3.xlsx`, `company1.csv`, `ESD.xlsx`: Sample datasets used for operations.

## 🔥 Why This Practice Matters

Handling real-world data often requires extensive cleaning, preprocessing, and reshaping before any meaningful analysis can be done.  
This project has helped strengthen my skills in preparing datasets efficiently and confidently.

## 🌟 Future Plans

- Work on more advanced Pandas operations
- Explore real-world datasets for deeper analysis
- Integrate visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib for EDA
