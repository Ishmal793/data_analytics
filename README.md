# Python Basics: Functions, Modules, and NumPy

This notebook covers core Python programming concepts such as:

- ✅ Functions: Definitions, parameters, arguments, return values, recursion
- ✅ Lambda functions and variable scope (local vs global)
- ✅ Common function-based problems (max of three, prime check, Fibonacci, sum of list)
- ✅ Python Modules: `datetime`, `random`, and `math`
- ✅ NumPy: Array creation, indexing, slicing, reshaping, operations, aggregations, and statistics

## 🔧 Topics in Detail

### 📌 Functions
- Defining and calling functions
- Using *args for arbitrary arguments
- Recursive functions and return statements
- Lambda expressions for quick operations
- Function-based mini projects

### 📌 Modules
- Working with Python’s built-in modules:
  - `datetime` for date/time handling
  - `random` for generating random data
  - `math` for mathematical operations

### 📌 NumPy
- Creating arrays (1D, 2D)
- Indexing and slicing
- Mathematical operations (add, subtract, mod, divide, power)
- Array concatenation, stacking, and splitting
- Statistical functions: mean, median, std, var
- Filtering, searching, and correlation
